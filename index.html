                    <h1 style="text-align: center;">WHY ?</h1>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">We all know that New Zealand announced the ban on the use of plastic bags nationwide on July 1 this year. I wasn't mainly accustomed to the beginning, and I needed to have a shopping bag that I could use many times. At that time, my understanding of environmental protection was not deep enough. Until I saw a public service advertisement in Thailand and some national geographic reports, I realized the impact of plastic bags on our environment and the entire ecology.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: center;"> Environmental protection is a global issue and a problem we face every day. The most basic thing to do is waste sorting. This year, we implemented a waste sorting policy in Shanghai, China. From children to the elderly, we must learn to classify garbage. I think this is an excellent guide. For the development of our current society, I found that both web pages and applications are basically about green environmental protection. I think it is more important to make people green from the primary garbage classification. But I haven't found an application that teaches people how to classify garbage correctly. I hope to have a convenient medium, to sum up, some information to make people use it more quickly in real life.

                    <p style="text-align: center;">We are now developing more and more rapidly, and we are facing more and more problems. Environmental protection is the most critical issue for everyone. However, how many people know how to classify garbage? I hope to make an app to help more people solve this problem and also contribute to the green world. The purpose of this app is to give users a comprehensive understanding of spam classification and to categorize it consciously. At the same time, it can encourage more people to join the green action, which will set the point reward. This reward mechanism is provided based on the user uploading photos and answering the corresponding questions. We need a joint effort for a better future.</p>

                     

                     <h1 style="text-align: center;">AUDIENCE</h1>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">This software is for anyone, because any of us are producing garbage at any time, so this software is for everyone. Parents can use this software to teach children how to classify garbage and develop a good habit from childhood. For the elderly, the garbage can be disposed of reasonably, and some garbage can be reused, such as fertilizer for planting flowers, etc.</p>
